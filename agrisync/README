CROP YIELD PREDICTION
As of now, we are working on developing the front end, but the machine learning model has been trained and recommends the crops to be grown according to the input values.
We have put in standard input values,they can be changed to see variation in the o/p.
The o/p displays a list of crops from best to worst to be grown according to the i/p.

The trained model has been loaded already, so to run this project :
Run the main.py file, the o/p will be visible in the terminal.
